/// [SplashBloc] is responsible for managing the splash screen state while the app
/// is initializing in the background.
///
/// Other widgets can register themselves as "waiters" with the splash bloc by
/// adding an [AddSplashWaiterEvent] to the bloc. Registering as a waiter will
/// force the splash screen to remain visible until the waiter has notified the
/// bloc that it has completed initialization via the [RemoveSplashWaiterEvent].
///
/// Once all waiters have notified the bloc that they are complete, the splash
/// screen will be hidden.
///
/// By default, [SplashBloc] does wait for at least one [RemoveSplashWaiterEvent]
/// before hiding the splash screen. If you are using Haven to manage your splash
/// screen then this is called automatically, but if you are using the bloc
/// directly you will need to call [RemoveSplashWaiterEvent] at least once.
///
/// The splash screen can also be forced to hide by adding a [ForceHideSplashEvent]
/// to the bloc.
